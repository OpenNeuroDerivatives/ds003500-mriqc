    "TaskDescription": "Participants were presented 12, 18-trial, blocks of a response inhibition task. Half of the blocks were designated as go blocks and half were no-go blocks. Block type alternated, beginning with a go block.  During go blocks, participants were instructed to respond as quickly as possible by pressing a button below their index finger for all shapes and during no-go (stop) blocks were instructed to inhibit response if a red triangle was present. At the beginning of each block the participant was reminded of the type of block with warning text reading ‘Go’ or ‘Stop’ that lasted 2300 ms followed by 300ms of blank screen. While intended block type alternated and began with a go-block, occasionally participants performed the task according to the instructions of the opposing block type, these were identified and recoded as the performed block type in the events.tsv files and noted in the comments for these blocks. In all trials, stimuli consisted of 3x3 matrices of shapes that contained 8 distractor stimuli (blue triangles and red trapezoids) and one additional shape that was either a target (red triangle) or a distractor. Trials were counterbalanced to include an equal number of targets in each of the nine positions across stimuli. Distractors were positioned in each stimulus such that there were no more than three of the same distractor adjacent on a side. All stimuli used in this dataset are provided in the stimuli director at the root level of the dataset. For array stimuli, distractors/target stimuli were presented such that they filled in the hole of the array of 8 distractors. Each block contained 18 trials arranged into six three-trial sets. In each trial participants were presented with the stimulus for 1400ms followed by an inter-trial interval (ITI) of 450, 600 or 750ms. Participants could respond as soon as the stimulus appeared and until the end of the ITI. Each set of three trials contained one trial with an ITI of 450ms, one with an ITI of 600ms and one with an ITI of 750ms such that total duration of each set of three trials was 6000ms. This variable duration of ITI was implemented in order to limit participants ability to pace. Order of trial ITI within a triplet was randomly sampled. Stimuli were sampled such that an individual stimulus was presented with the same ITI across subjects but not necessarily in the same order.",
