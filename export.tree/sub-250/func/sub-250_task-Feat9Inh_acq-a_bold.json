    "TaskDescription": "Participants were presented 12, 18-trial, blocks of a response inhibition task. Half of the blocks were designated as go blocks and half were no-go blocks. Block type alternated, beginning with a go block.  During go blocks, participants were instructed to respond as quickly as possible by pressing a button below their index finger for all shapes and during no-go (stop) blocks were instructed to inhibit response if a yellow shape was present. At the beginning of each block the participant was reminded of the type of block with warning text reading ‘Go’ or ‘Stop’ that lasted 2300 ms followed by 300ms of blank screen. While intended block type alternated and began with a go-block, occasionally participants performed the task according to the instructions of the opposing block type, these were identified and recoded as the performed block type in the events.tsv files and noted in the comments for these blocks. In all trials, stimuli consisted of 3x3 matrices of shapes that contained 8 distractor stimuli (blue triangles and red trapezoids) and one additional shape that was either a target (yellow trapezoid or yellow triangle) or a distractor. Trials were counterbalanced to include an equal number of targets in each of the nine positions across stimuli. Distractors were positioned in each stimulus such that there were no more than three of the same distractor adjacent on a side. All stimuli used in this dataset are provided in the stimuli director at the root level of the dataset. For array stimuli, distractors/target stimuli were presented such that they filled in the hole of the array of 8 distractors.",
